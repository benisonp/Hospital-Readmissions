# Hospital-Readmissions - Predicting the risk of readmission using classification algorithms

## Premise

In this personal project, I take a look at data from hospital patients in order to predict the risk of readmission for 
a given patient. As readmission is significantly detrimental to patient care, it is of key importance to hospitals to understand the risk factors leading to readmission, and hopefully improve their monitoring and treatment processes during 
a patient's stay at a hospital in order to mitigate the risk. 

This repository contains code for various aspects of the project such as wrangling, data visualization and statistical inference. For key takeaways, please refer to the 'Readmissions Project' notebook, as it represents the culmination of work done on this project, and contains recommendations I would make to the hospital administration on the basis of the findings.

## Essential Takeaways

Based on the models, some key factors that predict risk of readmission include variables about a patient's past, such as the number of times they have visited the hospital in the preceding year. Other risk factors include whether the patient is on anti-diabetes medication, as well as whether the patient is associated with the nephrology department during their stay at the hospital.
